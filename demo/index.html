            tranquility with
            them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts. Undoubtedly in these are signs for those who
            reflect.”(Quran,

                            Love is a powerful emotion. Throughout history couples in love have caused wars and
                            controversy, created masterpieces in
                            writing, music, and art, and have captured the hearts of the public with the power of their
                            bonds. From the allure of
                            Cleopatra to the magnetism of the Kennedy's, these love affairs have stood as markers in
                            history. Prepare to swoon over
                            these love stories of the centuries. “They say a good love is one that sits you down, gives
                            you a drink of water, and pats you on top of the head. But I say
                            a good love is one that casts you into the wind, sets you ablaze, makes you burn through the
                            skies and ignite the night
                            like a phoenix; the kind that cuts you loose like a wildfire and you can't stop running
                            simply because you keep on
                            burning everything that you touch! I say that's a good love; one that burns and flies, and
                            you run with it!”

                            The wind of summer is warm and moist. Such wind invokes a fuzzy feeling
                            inside one's heart. Especially the scene combined with the setting red sun. I thought to
                            myself again, will there ever
                            be the one? The one that I have longed for so long, the one that would
                            understand what I do and why I do it. The one that would support me and stay loyal to me as
                            I would to her. Will there
                            ever be the one that would fill the void in my heart and delve into
                            the world of imagination and fantasy? The summer scene was just enough to remind me that I
                            was from the day I knew,
                            alone indefinitely in this world until the end. Family can support
                            you, yes, but they can never fill that void of that longing for love. Given my age I was
                            perfect for union, however, the
                            biggest drawback was that I still could not provide for anyone.
                            I suddenly remembered one of my friends mentioning biye.com to me. He said
                            it was a website that helped a lot of people find their soulmates, but I was skeptical. I
                            had heard of many such
                            websites, but still, I decided to check it out and it turned out to be the best thing
                            of my life. Just after around 1 month of signing up to the website and adding my information
                            I got a hard match. I
                            talked with the girl first and then told my parents about it. She and I had so
                            much in common and we were in such sync like we were meant to be for each other. My parents
                            contacted hers and thus our
                            happily ever after started. To this day I would suggest anyone struggling
                            to use this website. The void was finally filled with a person that meant the world to me
                            and her name is
                            (toidi)Reverse.

                            We've heard of the Wall—no, not that one, the 2nd Century AD one stretching across
                            England—but what about Emperor
                            Hadrian's heart? He lost it to Antinous (far left), an intelligent and sports-loving Greek
                            student. The emperor
                            displayed "an obsessive craving for his presence." The two traveled together, pursuing their
                            love of hunting; Hadrian
                            once saved his lover's life during a lion hunt. The emperor even wrote erotic poetry. While
                            visiting the Nile, Antinous
                            drowned mysteriously, but some say he was murdered by those jealous of the emperor's
                            devotion. The devastated Hadrian
                            proclaimed Antinous a deity, ordered a city be built in his honor, and named a star after
                            him, between the Eagle and the
                            Zodiac.
